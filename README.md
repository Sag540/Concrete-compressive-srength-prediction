# Concrete-compressive-srength-prediction
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. So, by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we need for acceptable compressive strength, a lot of time and efforts can be saved.
